# AI Features Implementation Details

This document provides in-depth information about the AI features in SlackAI and how they are implemented.

## üß† Org Brain

The Org Brain provides organizational knowledge retrieval across all public channels and documents.

### Implementation

1. **Data Indexing**:
   - All public channel messages and uploaded files are processed through an embedding pipeline
   - Text is converted to vector embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
   - Embeddings are stored in Pinecone's vector database for efficient semantic search
   - Incremental indexing processes new messages in real-time

2. **Query Processing**:
   - User questions are converted to embeddings using the same model
   - Pinecone's vector similarity search finds the most relevant messages and documents
   - Search results are ranked and filtered for relevance
   - Top results are used as context for a summarization prompt

3. **Response Generation**:
   - OpenAI's GPT model receives filtered context and the user's query
   - Custom prompt engineering ensures responses are concise, informative, and cite sources
   - Responses include direct links to the original messages for further exploration

4. **Technical Components**:
   - `/backend/src/services/ai/pineconeService.ts`: Vector database integration
   - `/backend/src/services/ai/embeddingService.ts`: Text to vector embedding
   - `/backend/src/services/ai/orgBrainService.ts`: Main query processing logic
   - `/backend/src/controllers/aiController.ts`: API endpoints for Org Brain
   - `/frontend/src/components/OrgBrainSidebar.tsx`: UI for the Org Brain feature

## ‚úçÔ∏è Auto-Reply Composer

AI-powered response suggestions for faster communication based on context.

### Implementation

1. **Context Collection**:
   - When "Suggest Reply" is clicked, the system collects:
     - The message being replied to
     - Previous messages in the thread or conversation
     - Information about the participants and channel
     - Related messages from past conversations (using vector similarity)

2. **Response Generation**:
   - Context is sent to the OpenAI API with a specialized prompt
   - The prompt includes guidance on tone, style, and format
   - The API generates multiple response options (typically 3)
   - Each option is rated for formality, directness, and tone

3. **User Interface**:
   - Response options are presented in an interactive UI
   - Users can select, edit, or discard suggestions
   - Selected suggestions are inserted into the message input for further editing

4. **Technical Components**:
   - `/backend/src/services/ai/replyService.ts`: Auto-reply generation logic
   - `/frontend/src/components/AutoReplyComposer.tsx`: UI component for reply suggestions

## üìä Tone & Impact Meter

Real-time feedback on message tone to improve communication clarity.

### Implementation

1. **Analysis Process**:
   - As users type, the message content is sent to the backend for analysis
   - Analysis is throttled to prevent excessive API calls (typically 500ms delay)
   - Text is analyzed for:
     - Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
     - Formality level
     - Clarity and conciseness
     - Potential impact (based on content and addressees)

2. **Feedback Generation**:
   - Analysis results are processed into actionable feedback
   - Suggestions focus on improving clarity and aligning tone with intent
   - Impact rating considers message content, recipients, and context

3. **User Interface**:
   - Visual indicators show tone and impact ratings
   - Hover tooltips provide specific suggestions
   - Inline highlights identify phrases that might be improved

4. **Technical Components**:
   - `/backend/src/services/ai/toneService.ts`: Tone analysis logic
   - `/frontend/src/components/ToneImpactMeter.tsx`: UI component for tone feedback

## üìù Meeting Notes Generator

Automatic generation of structured summaries from conversations.

### Implementation

1. **Content Collection**:
   - When "Generate Meeting Notes" is clicked:
     - Messages from the selected thread or time period are collected
     - Messages are filtered by relevance and content type
     - User information is added for context

2. **Notes Generation**:
   - Collected messages are processed through a custom OpenAI prompt
   - The prompt specifies the structure for the notes:
     - Key discussion points
     - Decisions made
     - Action items with assignees
     - Follow-up questions
     - Timeline and deadlines

3. **Output and Sharing**:
   - Generated notes are displayed in a formatted view
   - Users can edit the notes before finalizing
   - Export options include Markdown, HTML, or direct channel sharing

4. **Technical Components**:
   - `/backend/src/services/ai/meetingNotesService.ts`: Notes generation logic
   - `/frontend/src/components/MeetingNotesGenerator.tsx`: UI for notes generation

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

The AI features are designed for continuous improvement:

1. **Feedback Loop**:
   - User interactions with AI suggestions are logged
   - Accepted, edited, and rejected suggestions provide training signals
   - System periodically updates embeddings and fine-tunes prompts

2. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - AI features can be selectively enabled/disabled via environment variables
   - Gradual rollout allows for A/B testing of different approaches
   - Performance metrics track API usage and response times
